Within the EC Conquest project, a full featured DICOM server has been
developed based on and heavily extending the public domain UCDMC DICOM
code developed by Mark Oskin when he was at the Medical Center of the
University of California at Davis.

The Conquest DICOM software was written by Marcel van Herk and Lambert
Zijp at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. We have decided to provide
our extended DICOM software also to the public domain.
